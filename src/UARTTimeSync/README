This component is used to synchronize all nodes on global system time via UART.
Whole component is based on FloodTimeSynchronizationProtocol (ftsp) [1] with difference whole 
communication is made by UART and server is root node that synchronizes every node
in network. 

Node listens to messages on UART interface, when TimeSyncMessage is received, it stores data to table.
Linear regression is used to compute clock skew.
