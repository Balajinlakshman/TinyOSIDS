This component is used to ease sending report messages to serial (uart). 

It is message queue where message can be pushed. Component tries to send message
several times until is message sent correctly. User don't have to bother with
re-sending, sendDone handling, locking and busy checking stuff. 

Messages in queue are sent as soon as possible.
