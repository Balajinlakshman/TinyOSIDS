Simple radio jammer application.

Jammer sends IEEE 802.15.4 compliant frames as fast as possible. Using fast retransmissions
without repeatedly acquiring/releasing SPI bus, TXFIFO filling and another packet send overhead.

Jammer uses modified low level radio stack files to operate well. It was designed to be able to 
switch jamming on/off and to be able to send normal radio frames as well (disable jamming).

== Optimization ==

There are still some problems with optimality. Sometimes occurs TXFIFO underflow, then
transmission fails, TXFIFO needs to be re-filled and packet retransmitted. This causes
gap in jamming. 

Another problem is with transmission fail. After strobing STXON Backofftimer is started
to wait for SFD pin goes high signalling that SFD was transmitted. When no SFD high event 
occurs in backoff timer period, timeout occurs and packet needs to be retransmitted.

One may enable debugging for this application - printf statistics to tune packet size,
backoff times to achieve best possible configuration for optimal jamming. 

Packet size and backoff timers has strong relation for jammer effectivity (longer frame 
needs more time to trasmit). Too short frame occupies radio channel only for a short period
of time.

== Effectivity ==

For nearby nodes is current effectivity of jammer 99.73% (means that nearby node can 
see clear channel only 0.27% of total time).
