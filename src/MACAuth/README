This components helps to determine whether was received message correctly authenticated or not.

In tinyos 2.1.1 there is no check implemented on message authenticity! Message can be sent 
authenticated, auth check is performed in HW (CC2420 case), but result of such check is just ignored
and MIC bytes are stripped off. As a consequence, unauthenticated message will pass to upper layer 
with no problem. 

This is specifically intended for CC2420 chip. Since there is no support for authenticity checking
in lower layers, this is only for this particular chip. There are some assumptions on
packet format (see CC2420 data sheet, MIC section) that probably does not hold with different
radio chip.

For more information see MACAuth interface, it is well documented and usage should be 
straightforward.
