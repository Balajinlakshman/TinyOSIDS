Similar to QueueC component, but this takes structure passed as a pointer and copies 
it into the memory slot allocated for it in queue. 

Thus using this component one can initialize local structure and push to queue. 
There is no need to take care about buffers in user code. After push (enqueue) you can
modify local structure without modifying pushed structure, it remains same.
